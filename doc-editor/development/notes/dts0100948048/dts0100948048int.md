xtUML Project Implementation Note  
Not possible to assign a polymorphic event in a class SM if the supertype class is imported


1. Abstract
-----------
It's not possible to assign a polymorphic event to a transition in a class SM if 
the supertype class is imported.
This note resolves this issue.

7. Implementation Comments
--------------------------
7.1 UI Wizards are generally three pieces:  Wizard, WizardPages and Action
   The code generation skips operation invocation statement generation for wizard 
   pages, The pages are used for selections while the work is done in the wizard 
   class.  
   In order to generate code from OAL, the blocks of the OAL are checked, and 
   then special bridges that allow the generation to know where these selection 
   steps occur. Instead of cleanly generating the code, everything from the OAL 
   body is just generated, skipping any operations as it is  possible to call 
   those until the user presses finish or OK.

   This generation technique has conflict the issue implementation since 
   the implementation uses operation invocation ( package.clearscope() and
   package.collectVisibleElement(..)
   
   A decision is taken to change wizard from combo box to use selector dialogs
   as in Set Type, but due to time limitations, a seperate issue raised to 
   address this issue, and  "GenericPackageAssignEventOnSM_TXNWizardPage1"
   will be version controlled and skipped in the build generation, and manually
   edit it to implement the design
